# Landing Page

A webpage showcasing my newly acquired CSS skills, particularly the use of flex
layouts to create complex page designs.

CSS properties demonstrated include flex-direction, justify-content,
align-items, align-content, min-width, and max-width.

Based on the Landing Page project from The Odin Project.
